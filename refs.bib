abstract = {The fast rate of adoption of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets has made digital content consumption one of the largest growth areas in consumer technology and the ubiquity of Wi-Fi has helped to enable that growth. Wi-Fi has enabled users to easily access and view online multimedia content on their mobile devices. The user experience can be further enhanced by enabling mobile devices to wirelessly stream content such as online videos, movies, games and webpages to external high definition displays. This Paper presents the various ways of wirelessly sharing the content using the Miracast technology an open wireless display standard created by Wi-Fi alliance through an application, by using Miracast. The expense for cabling and switch equipment can be reduced using this technology. },
